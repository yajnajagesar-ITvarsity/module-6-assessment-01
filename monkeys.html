                            <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
    <p>As apes have emerged in the monkey group as sister of the old world monkeys, characteristics
           that describe monkeys are generally shared by apes as well. Williams et al outlined 
           evolutionary features, including in stem groupings, contrasted against the other primates
            such as the tarsiers and the lemuriformes.</p>
     <p>Monkeys range in size from the pygmy marmoset, which can be as small as 117 millimetres
            (4.6 in) with a 172-millimetre (6.8 in) tail and just over 100 grams (3.5 oz) in weight,[33] 
            to the male mandrill, almost 1 metre (3.3 ft) long and weighing up to 36 kilograms (79 lb).[34]
             Some are arboreal (living in trees) while others live on the savanna; diets differ among the
              various species but may contain any of the following: fruit, leaves, seeds, nuts, flowers,
               eggs and small animals (including insects and spiders).[35]</p>
   <p>Some characteristics are shared among the groups; most New World monkeys have prehensile tails while
          Old World monkeys have non-prehensile tails or no visible tail at all. Old World monkeys have 
          trichromatic color vision like that of humans, while New World monkeys may be trichromatic,
           dichromatic, or—as in the owl monkeys and greater galagos—monochromatic. Although both the New 
           and Old World monkeys, like the apes, have forward-facing eyes, the faces of Old World and New 
           World monkeys look very different, though again, each group shares some features such as the
            types of noses, cheeks and rumps.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E2, on the monkey trail.</p>
